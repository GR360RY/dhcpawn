# Installation and Deployment

## Using Docker

On your server, clone the source repository to a path on your system:

```
$ cd /opt
$ git clone <repo url> myapp
```

Build the docker image:

```
$ cd myapp
$ python manage.py docker build
```

Go have some coffee, then start your image

```
$ python manage.py docker start
```

This fetches the `postgres` Docker image, runs it along with your app and links them together.

*NOTE*: a `persistent` directory will appear in your source directory. Do not delete it, as it contains data used by your app, to be persisted between sessions


## Regular Installation using Ansible

Edit the file `ansible/inventories/production`, and fill in the name of your destination server. Here is an example of such a file:

```
[webapp]
my.server.com ansible_ssh_user=root
```

Then run:

```
python manage.py deploy --dest production
```

## Other Destinations

In addition to a destination server, you can also deploy to *staging*, or a beta server to test your deployment before hitting production.

`manage.py deploy --dest` also understand the *vagrant* argument, causing installation on a vagrant instance, and *localhost* meaning deploying on the local machine.
